## ReseauSocial
A Java project imitating a social network for the students of my faculty.
 
Features:
	
- separate accounts for students, teachers and admin personnel
- posts with text and media content, that can be liked by other users
- custom visibility for own posts (everyone, certain groups, certain users)
- groups
- messages (text and media content) between users
	
The ```test/testes``` folder contains JUnit tests for the database, professor accounts and student accounts.

Project realised for the Software Engineering (GÃ©nie de logiciel) course.
